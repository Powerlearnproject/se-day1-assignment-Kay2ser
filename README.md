#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications  It's is important in the technology industry in the following ways:
> Innovation and Progress: Software engineering drives technological advancements and solves complex problems.
> Efficiency and Productivity: Software applications automate tasks, streamline processes, and enable data-driven decisions.
> Economic Growth: The software industry creates jobs and contributes to economic development.
> Accessibility and Connectivity: Software facilitates global communication and digital inclusion.
> Quality of Life: Software enhances entertainment, healthcare, and education.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
> Punch Card Era: Early programming was done using punch cards, which were physical cards with holes representing instructions. This limited the complexity of software and required manual handling and processing.

> High-Level Languages: The introduction of FORTRAN and COBOL marked a significant advancement, as these languages were more abstract and easier to use than machine code. This made programming more accessible and efficient.

> Object-Oriented Programming: OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitated the development of larger and more complex software systems. Objects, representing real-world entities, could be reused and modified more easily.

> Agile Development: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, shifted the focus from traditional waterfall models to iterative and incremental development. This allowed for greater flexibility, adaptability to changing requirements, and continuous delivery of working software.

> Cloud Computing and DevOps: The rise of cloud computing platforms and DevOps practices revolutionized software development and deployment. Cloud-based infrastructure provided scalable and flexible resources, while DevOps combined development and operations teams to automate and streamline the software delivery process. This led to faster time-to-market and improved software quality.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
The project leaders define the project's goals, gather information from customers (if applicable), and create a project plan.
 
2. Requirements
The requirements phase involves analyzing client goals and defining the necessary features, components, and resources for the software.

3. Design and prototype
In this phase developers define the software's architecture, user interface, security measures, and programming language. They also create a prototype to visualize how the application will look and function.

4. Software development 
The developers write the code that brings the application to life. The team may consist of one or more developers, depending on the project's size

5.Testing
Software is evaluated for quality, functionality, and security. This often occurs concurrently with development to address issues promptly.

6.Deployment
It involves moving the software from the development environment to a live environment, often an app store. The tech support team monitors user feedback during this phase.

7. Maintenance. 
The launched software is monitored for bugs and errors. User feedback is analyzed to identify areas for improvement and plan future upgrades.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
> The Waterfall model follows a sequential linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next while Agile uses an iterative approach with frequent releases of working software
> Waterfall model emphasizes detailed documentation and predefined features for each phase while Agile model emphasizes continuous collaboration between developers and customers
> In Waterfall model, once a phase is complete it is difficult to make changes while in Agile allows for changes and adaptations throughout the development process
> Waterfall model is suitable for projects with well defined requirements and minimal uncertainty while Agile model is suitable for projects with evolving requirements, complex domains or need for rapid prototyping and feedback.
> Waterfall model can be used when building a large-scale software system with a fixed scope and timeline, developing a complex hardware product
> Agile model can be used when developing a new mobile app with uncertain market demand, creating a software product for a rapidly changing industry, building a data-driven application. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

> A software developer is responsible for designing, writing, testing and maintaining software applications. The can also be involved in fixing and debugging software defects.

> A quality assurance engineer ensures quality of software products by creating and executing test cases to identify defects. They ensure the software meets quality standards and user requirements.

> A project manager oversees the entire software development process to ensure it is completed on time, within budget, and to the desired quality standards.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

> IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development, including code editor, compiler/interpreter, debugger, build automation and source code management integration. Example of IDE is Visual Studio common for windows and also Eclipse.

> VCS is a software tool that tracks changes to a set of files over time. It allows developers to collaborate effectively on projects, manage different versions of code, and revert to previous states if necessary. Common examples are Git and Mercurial 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
> Rapid advancement of technology
Software engineers must continuously learn and adapt to new programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

> Increasing customer demands in development stage
Meeting the growing expectations of customers for faster delivery, better features, and higher quality requires effective communication and prioritization

> Time limitation.
Balancing quality with tight deadlines necessitates efficient planning, time management, and prioritization.

> Cyber Security.
Protecting software applications from security threats requires following industry best practices, regular updates, and penetration testing.

> Debugging.
Identifying and fixing errors in code can be challenging. Using debugging tools, code reviews, unit testing, and logging can help address this issue.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

> Unit Testing
Used to verify correctness of individual units of code. It ensures that each unit of code functions as expected, which helps catch errors early in the development process. 

> Integration Testing
Used to verify the interaction between different components or modules of the software. It ensures that components work together seamlessly and that there are no unexpected interactions or dependencies. 

> System Testing
It is used to verify the overall functionality of the software system as a whole. Ensures that the software meets the customer's needs and performs as expected in a real-world environment

> Acceptance testing
It's used to verify that the software meets the customer's requirements and is ready for deployment. Ensures that the software meets the customer's expectations and is acceptable for use.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence solutions to generate desired outputs. It is important as it ensures: 
> Clarity and Specificity: Well-crafted prompts provide clear instructions, ensuring the AI model understands the desired task and avoids misunderstandings.
> Relevance: Relevant prompts help the AI model focus on the most pertinent information, improving the accuracy and quality of its responses.
> Control: Effective prompt engineering allows users to guide the AI model's output towards specific outcomes, such as generating creative text, summarizing information, or answering questions in a particular style.
> Ethical Considerations. Prompt engineering can help mitigate biases and ensure that AI models generate responses that are fair, unbiased, and appropriate. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Promt: What is an engine 

Improved prompt: What is a car engine and classify them based on the number of cylinders including the type of fuel that is more appropriate and expected power output.

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides a clear and specific focus on car engines. It explicitly states the classification criterion (number of cylinders) and includes additional relevant factors (fuel type and expected power output). This makes the prompt more actionable and ensures that the response is focused, informative, and relevant to the intended topic.
